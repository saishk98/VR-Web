          The headset is designed to perfectly create an immersive 3D environment. Each VR headset puts up a screen (or two – one for each eye) in front of eyes thus, eliminating any interaction with the real world. Two autofocus lenses are generally placed between the screen and the eyes that adjust based on individual eye movement and positioning. The visuals on the screen are rendered either by using a mobile phone or HDMI cable connected to a PC.

        <h2 class="h2-question-title"><u>WebXR Device API</u></h2><br>
        <h3 class="h3-question-title"><u>What is WebXR?</u></h3><br>
        <p class="para-ms">
          <b>WebXR</b> is a group of standards which are used together to support rendering 3D scenes to hardware designed for presenting virtual worlds (<b>virtual reality</b>, or <b>VR</b>), or for adding graphical imagery to the real world, (<b>augmented reality</b>, or <b>AR</b>). The <b>WebXR Device API</b> implements the core of the WebXR feature set, managing the selection of output devices, render the 3D scene to the chosen device at the appropriate frame rate, and manage motion vectors created using input controllers.<br><br>
          WebXR-compatible devices include fully immersive 3D headsets with motion and orientation tracking, eyeglasses which overlay graphics atop the real-world scene passing through the frames, and handheld mobile phones which augment reality by capturing the world with a camera and augment that scene with computer-generated imagery.<br><br>
          To accomplish these things, the WebXR Device API provides the following key capabilities:<br><br>
          •	Find compatible VR or AR output devices.<br>
          •	Render a 3D scene to the device at an appropriate frame rate.<br>
          •	(Optionally) mirror the output to a 2D display.<br>
          •	Create vectors representing the movements of input controls.<br><br>
          <b>Abstract</b>: This specification describes support for accessing virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) devices, including sensors and head-mounted displays, on the Web.
        </p><br>
        <h3 class="h3-question-title"><u>Concepts & Usage</u></h3><br>
        <p class="para-ms">
          While the older WebVR API was designed solely to support Virtual Reality (VR), WebXR provides support for both VR and Augmented Reality (AR) on the web. Support for AR functionality is added by the WebXR Augmented Reality Module.<br><br>
          A typical XR device can have either 3 or 6 degrees of freedom and might or might not have an external positional sensor.<br><br>
          The equipment may also include an accelerometer, barometer, or other sensors which are used to sense when the user moves through space, rotates their head, or the like.<br><img src="images/vr-img28.jpg" alt="vr-img-p4" id="vr-img-p4" width="50" height="100">

          •	<b>Babylon</b>: Babylon.js is an easy-to-use real-time 3D game engine built using TypeScript.

        <h2 class="h2-question-title"><u>What will the future of Virtual Reality be like in Web?</u></h2><br>
        <p class="para-ms">
          Virtual Reality is one of the technologies with the highest projected potential for growth.<br><br>
          According to the latest forecasts from IDC (International Data Corporation) Research, investment in VR and AR will multiply 21-fold over the next four years, reaching 15.5 billion euros by 2022. Both technologies will be key to companies' digital transformation plans and their spending in this area will exceed that of the consumer sector by 2019. Therefore, it is expected that by 2020 over half of the larger European companies would have VR & AR strategy.<br><br>
          The big technology companies are already working to develop headsets that do not need cables and that allow images to be seen in HD. They are developing Virtual Reality headsets in 8K and with much more powerful processors. <br><br>
          There is even talk that in the next few years they could integrate Artificial Intelligence. The latest 5G standard can also provide very interesting scenarios for the evolution of VR. This standard will allow more devices and large user communities to be connected. <br><br>
          All this means that Virtual Reality is no longer science fiction. It is integrated into our present and, in the coming years, it will lead to advances that will shape the future.
